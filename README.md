Define Requirements: Gathered detailed requirements from stakeholders including scalability, security, performance, and regulatory compliance needs.

Architecture Design: Designed a high-level architecture diagram outlining components and interactions using AWS services.

2. Infrastructure Setup
AWS VPC Setup:

Created a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with appropriate CIDR blocks for public and private subnets.
Configured route tables, internet gateway, and NAT gateway for outbound internet access.
Subnet Configuration:

Created public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
Assigned security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Compute Resources Deployment:

Deployed EC2 instances in private subnets for backend services using Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
Configured Auto Scaling groups to automatically adjust capacity based on traffic patterns.
3. Serverless Implementation
AWS Lambda Functions:

Developed Lambda functions in Python for handling specific tasks such as user authentication, order processing, and inventory management.
Integrated Lambda with Amazon API Gateway to expose RESTful APIs securely.
DynamoDB Setup:

Created DynamoDB tables for NoSQL data storage, including user profiles, product catalogs, and session management.
Implemented DynamoDB Streams for capturing and reacting to changes in real-time.
4. CI/CD Pipeline
AWS CodePipeline Configuration:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
Integrated GitHub or AWS CodeCommit repositories as the source stage for triggering pipeline executions.
CodeBuild and CodeDeploy:

Configured CodeBuild to compile application code, run unit tests, and package artifacts for deployment.
Utilized CodeDeploy to deploy application updates automatically to EC2 instances and Lambda functions.
5. Data Storage and Management
AWS S3 Bucket Configuration:

Created S3 buckets for storing static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript libraries.
Implemented versioning and lifecycle policies to manage object retention and access.
AWS RDS Deployment:

Launched Amazon RDS instances for relational database management, including MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.
Configured Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and automated backups for data durability.
6. Monitoring and Logging
AWS CloudWatch Integration:

Configured CloudWatch alarms to monitor EC2 instance metrics, Lambda function invocations, and API Gateway performance.
Set up custom CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
Grafana Dashboard Setup:

Installed and configured Grafana for advanced visualization of metrics collected from AWS CloudWatch.
Created Grafana dashboards to monitor system performance, resource utilization, and application health.
7. Cost Optimization
AWS Cost Explorer Analysis:

Analyzed AWS usage and costs using AWS Cost Explorer to identify cost drivers and optimize spending.
Implemented tagging strategies and reserved instances to reduce overall infrastructure costs.
Trusted Advisor Recommendations:

Leveraged AWS Trusted Advisor to receive actionable recommendations for improving security, reducing costs, and enhancing performance.
Implemented recommendations related to security group rules, IAM policies, and service limits.
8. Big Data Analytics Integration
AWS Glue ETL Jobs:

Designed and implemented AWS Glue ETL jobs to transform and prepare data for analytics purposes.
Scheduled and monitored Glue jobs using AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
AWS Athena Query Execution:

Configured AWS Athena to run ad-hoc SQL queries directly against data stored in Amazon S3.
Created Athena views and saved queries for frequently accessed datasets.
AWS Kinesis Data Streams:

Implemented Kinesis Data Streams to capture and process real-time data streams from application logs and user interactions.
Integrated Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time data analysis and anomaly detection.
9. Deployment and Testing
Staging Environment Deployment:

Deployed the cloud-native e-commerce platform to a staging environment for testing and validation of functionality and performance.
Conducted integration tests, performance tests, and security assessments in the staging environment.
Load Testing:

Utilized tools like Apache JMeter or AWS Load Testing services to simulate high traffic volumes and measure system response under load.
Optimized application settings and infrastructure configurations based on load testing results.
10. Documentation and Handover
Documentation Preparation:

Created comprehensive documentation including architecture diagrams, deployment guides, operational procedures, and troubleshooting steps.
Documented infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform templates for reproducibility.
Knowledge Transfer:

Conducted knowledge transfer sessions with the operations team, developers, and stakeholders to ensure understanding of platform components and operations.
Provided training on monitoring tools, incident response procedures, and best practices for cloud-native application management.
11. Post-Deployment Optimization
Performance Tuning:

Optimized application performance by fine-tuning Lambda function memory allocation, database query optimizations, and caching strategies.
Implemented CDN (Content Delivery Network) solutions like AWS CloudFront for improved content delivery and reduced latency.
Security Enhancements:

Enhanced platform security by implementing encryption at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and SSL/TLS certificates.
Conducted regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with industry standards.
12. Maintenance and Support
Ongoing Monitoring:

Established proactive monitoring using AWS CloudWatch alarms and automated notifications to detect and respond to system anomalies.
Monitored and analyzed application logs and metrics to troubleshoot issues and optimize system performance.
Incident Management:

Implemented incident response procedures and escalation protocols to address and resolve production issues promptly.
Conducted post-incident reviews (PIRs) to identify root causes and implement preventive measures.
